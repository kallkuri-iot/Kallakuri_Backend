## 📋 **Critical Points for App Developer**

### **🚨 BREAKING CHANGES:**
1. **Task ID Required:** All activity APIs now require `taskId` parameter
2. **Punch-Out URL Changed:** No longer uses activity ID in URL path
3. **Enhanced Validation:** Stricter field validation for data quality

### **🔄 MIGRATION STEPS:**
1. **Update API calls** to include `taskId` in all activity endpoints
2. **Change punch-out URL** from `/{id}/punch-out` to `/punch-out`
3. **Add task management** in mobile app to get `taskId` values
4. **Update error handling** for new validation messages
5. **Test complete flow** with task-based tracking

### **📊 DATA FLOW:**
```
Task Assignment → Get taskId → Punch In (with taskId) → 
Visit Shops (with same taskId) → Punch Out (with same taskId) → 
Admin Panel shows grouped activities
```
